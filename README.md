This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Booking

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

I'm pretty lazy, and I want stuff automated. So that's why I made this.
